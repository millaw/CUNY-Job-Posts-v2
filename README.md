- Shortcode usage: `[cunyc_job_posts]` displays the job postings from the default URL.
- Customizable college job feed URL inside Settings page.
- Supports job title, date posted, job ID, description, and application links for current CUNY employees and external applicants.
- Easy to integrate into any WordPress page or post using the shortcode.

## Usage

To display job postings, use the `[cunyc_job_posts]` shortcode anywhere on your WordPress site, such as in a page, post, or widget.

### Example:

To display the default job postings for CUNY colleges:

```plaintext
[cunyc_job_posts]
```

### Custom College URL:

You can specify a custom job feed URL by adding it on the Settings page.

Replace `https://example.com/jobs/feed/json` with the actual JSON feed URL of the CUNY college you want to display job postings for.

## Configuration

- **Default Job Feed URL**: If no `college_url` attribute is provided, the plugin will fetch job postings from a default CUNY college job feed.
- **Shortcode Attribute**: The `college_url` attribute allows the plugin to fetch job postings from other CUNY colleges by providing their job feed URL.

## Enqueued Scripts and Styles

The plugin registers and enqueues the following files:

- `cuny-jp-script.js`: A JavaScript file for handling interactions such as toggling the job details.
- `cuny-jp-style.css`: A CSS file for styling the job posts.

Both files are registered and enqueued when the plugin is activated.
